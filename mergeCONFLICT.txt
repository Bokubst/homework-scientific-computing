this is the file to change...
ok, I'll do it myself - 
step1: load file to server
step2: make changes to file
step3: delete file on server
step4: push changed file to server
step5: see what happens ...

$ git push
To https://github.com/Bokubst/homework-scientific-computing
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Bokubst/homework-scientific-computing'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

step5a: fetch first

$ git fetch https://github.com/Bokubst/homework-scientific-computing
remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 2 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (2/2), 604 bytes | 120.00 KiB/s, done.
From https://github.com/Bokubst/homework-scientific-computing
 * branch            HEAD       -> FETCH_HEAD

step5b: not exactly what I wanted

$ git push
To https://github.com/Bokubst/homework-scientific-computing
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Bokubst/homework-scientific-computing'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

step5c: use pull instead

$ git pull https://github.com/Bokubst/homework-scientific-computing
From https://github.com/Bokubst/homework-scientific-computing
 * branch            HEAD       -> FETCH_HEAD
CONFLICT (modify/delete): mergeCONFLICT.txt deleted in 303fbe57b664aa0f4c8b7fded9993be5bfb7894a and modified in HEAD. Version HEAD of mergeCONFLICT.txt left in tree.
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

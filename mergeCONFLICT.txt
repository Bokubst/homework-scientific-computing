this is the file to change...
ok, I'll do it myself - 
step1: load file to server
step2: make changes to file
step3: delete file on server
step4: push changed file to server
step5: see what happens ...

$ git push
To https://github.com/Bokubst/homework-scientific-computing
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Bokubst/homework-scientific-computing'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

step5a: fetch first

$ git fetch https://github.com/Bokubst/homework-scientific-computing
remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 2 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (2/2), 604 bytes | 120.00 KiB/s, done.
From https://github.com/Bokubst/homework-scientific-computing
 * branch            HEAD       -> FETCH_HEAD

step5b: not exactly what I wanted

$ git push
To https://github.com/Bokubst/homework-scientific-computing
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Bokubst/homework-scientific-computing'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

step5c: use pull instead

$ git pull https://github.com/Bokubst/homework-scientific-computing
From https://github.com/Bokubst/homework-scientific-computing
 * branch            HEAD       -> FETCH_HEAD
CONFLICT (modify/delete): mergeCONFLICT.txt deleted in 303fbe57b664aa0f4c8b7fded9993be5bfb7894a and modified in HEAD. Version HEAD of mergeCONFLICT.txt left in tree.
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

step6: read 'addressing merge confict' article on Github

step7: 

$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." as appropriate to mark resolution)
        deleted by them: mergeCONFLICT.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

$ git add mergeCONFLICT.txt

$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:
        modified:   mergeCONFLICT.txt

$ git commit -m 'Change mergeCONFLICT.txt'
[master 0202256] Change mergeCONFLICT.txt

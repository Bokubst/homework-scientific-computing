this is the file to change...
ok, I'll do it myself - 
step1: load file to server
step2: make changes to file
step3: delete file on server
step4: push changed file to server
step5: see what happens ...

$ git push
To https://github.com/Bokubst/homework-scientific-computing
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Bokubst/homework-scientific-computing'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

step5a: fetch first

step6: read 'addressing merge confict' article on Github
